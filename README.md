### Hi, Evgeny is here ðŸ‘‹

### I am a data scientist with Bachelors in Engineering and substantial experience with getting actionable insights from data and improving decision-making.

I am proud of new big achievment of mine. I get graduated from Galvanize Data Science Bootcamp. 

A 13-week immersive, 400+ hours of coding, Python-based curriculum that is focused on machine learning and best practices in statistical analysis, including frequentist and Bayesian methods. Utilizing regression, classification, and clustering to model real-world structured and unstructured data. Explores NLP and Deep Learning techniques, in addition to Spark on AWS.
